[Verse 1]
Sunshine ah hit
Get off the sheets
I say a little prayer and I burn a spliff
Because I still dey breathe, I'm on my feet and I know tons of niggas still hoping I quit jigga
My shit legit, ko si elomi
Not where I want to be yet so I still dey push jigga
And I don't ever fail to bring the heat
And nobody stopping this, so you can watch this

[Chorus]
I've never stopped in my life so tell me why would I stop now
Much to achieve in my life, I hustle till the sun comes down
Can't throw dirt on my hustle my spirit you can't bring it down
You know I've never stopped in my life so tell me why you think that I'll stop now
Oh no no
I'vе never stopped in my lifе so tell me why would I stop now
Know there's much to achieve in my life, I hustle till the sun comes down
Oh you can't throw dirt on my hustle my spirit you can't bring it down
You know I've never stopped in my life so tell me why you think that I'll stop now

[Verse 2]
Para para
Who say Buju no fit sing go tell the motherfucker
I drop 16 bars rounds your favorite rapper
And I'm a singing nigga wey still sabi flow proper
Big giant, Five fo fumb, smell dinner
You're looking at a mix of Burna boy and 2Baba
With a sprinkle of Khalid and frank ocean sha
You get me sha
And you know say these people no dey my radar
See Ayanfe mi gan gan
Ofe shemi bi oun nkan
And she tell me when I don't call
She tells me it's an insult
How you feeling tonight
You see the people jamming tonight
And when the music playing all night
Girl you know I'll be doing you right , later
On in the night you know

[Chorus]
I've never stopped in my life so tell me why would I stop now
Much to achieve in my life , I hustle till the sun comes down
No you Can't throw dirt on my hustle my spirit you can't bring it down
You know I've never stopped in my life so tell me why you think that I'll stop now
I've never stopped in my life so tell me why would I stop now
Much to achieve in my life , I hustle till the sun comes down
No you Can't throw dirt on my hustle my spirit you can't bring it down
You know I've never stopped in my life so tell me why you think that I'll stop now

[Outro] 
Para para
Who say Buju no fit sing go tell the motherfucker
I drop 16 bars rounds your favorite rapper
And I'm a singing nigga wey still sabi flow proper
Big giant, Five fo fumb, smell dinner
You're looking at a mix of Burna boy and 2Baba
